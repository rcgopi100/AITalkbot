# AITalkbot
Articial Intelligence Talkbot on Neural Network Natural Language Processing

Steps to follow:
1. Download all files
2. Install all libraries which are their in header.
3. Note: Pyaudio needs to install manully so I given a separate file which you need to run manually from command prompt and install based on your version which the system accepts.
4. I ran into PyAudio issue when I install onto Mac, so Windows PC would be beter to install these packages otherwise you end up PyAudio error on Mac.
5. Run talkbotnlp if you don't want to add more any intents on talkbot
6. If you want to call this Talkbot on SAP FIORI UI then you need to update Intents and call Python function and call necessarry libariries and functions to call backend to get data.
